# **Portfolio Sample: Bama Platform Migration â€“ .NET Core Microservices**

**Role:** Lead Backend Developer
**Tech Stack:** C#, .NET Core, EF Core, Dapper, Redis, Elasticsearch, SQL Server, RabbitMQ, Docker, CI/CD, Serilog, Keycloak, DDD, CQRS, Clean Architecture

---

## **Project Overview**

Led the full migration of a high-traffic legacy MVC platform to a scalable .NET Core microservices architecture serving 50k+ daily users. The project demonstrates expertise in system design, backend optimization, team leadership, and cloud-native deployments.

Key Goals:

* Modernize architecture from monolith to microservices
* Improve performance, scalability, and reliability
* Introduce maintainable, testable, and secure systems
* Guide the team through complex technical transitions

## **Key Contributions**

* **Architecture & Design:**

  * Designed modular microservices architecture using **DDD** and **CQRS** principles.
  * Applied **Clean Architecture** for maintainability and separation of concerns.

* **Performance Optimization:**

  * Reduced API latency by up to **60%** and query times by **70%** using Redis caching, async I/O, EF Core/Dapper optimizations, and SQL tuning.
  * Elasticsearch enabled advanced search and filtering for vehicle ads.

* **Feature Development:**

  * Built key business modules: Pricing APIs, Vehicle Ads management, SMS/Telegram notifications, Payment and Wallet microservices.
  * Integrated SSO with Keycloak and secure token-based authentication (JWT).

* **Team Leadership:**

  * Mentored junior developers, conducted code reviews, and enforced SOLID & clean coding practices.
  * Facilitated knowledge sharing and cross-team collaboration.

* **DevOps & CI/CD:**

  * Dockerized services for consistent deployments.
  * Implemented CI/CD pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment processes.
  * Centralized logging and monitoring via Serilog + Elasticsearch.
