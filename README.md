**Project:** Bama Platform Migration â€“ .NET Core Microservices
**Role:** Lead Backend Developer

**Overview:**
Led the full migration of a high-traffic legacy MVC platform to a modern .NET Core microservices architecture, serving over 50,000 daily active users. The project demonstrates my ability to design scalable, maintainable systems while leading a team through complex technical transformations.

**Key Contributions & Achievements:**

* **Architecture & Design:** Designed microservices using DDD and CQRS principles, enabling modular, maintainable, and future-proof system architecture. Applied Clean Architecture to separate concerns and ensure long-term flexibility.
* **Performance Optimization:** Reduced API latency by up to 60% and improved critical query performance by 70% through Redis caching, async I/O operations, EF Core/Dapper optimization, and SQL query tuning.
* **Search & Data Retrieval:** Integrated Elasticsearch to provide advanced indexing and retrieval for vehicle ads, enabling complex filtering and boosting user experience for high-volume searches.
* **Feature Implementation:** Developed key business modules, including pricing estimation APIs, heavy vehicle ads management, notifications via SMS/Telegram bots, and payment/digital wallet microservices.
* **Team Leadership & Mentorship:** Mentored junior developers, conducted code reviews, enforced SOLID principles and Clean Architecture, and improved team velocity and code quality.
* **DevOps & Deployment:** Dockerized all services, implemented CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployment, and integrated centralized logging with Serilog and Elasticsearch for observability.
* **Security & Compliance:** Implemented Keycloak-based SSO and robust authentication/authorization across microservices to ensure secure user access.
* **Collaboration & Agile Practices:** Actively participated in requirement refinement, cross-team coordination, and agile ceremonies, ensuring smooth integration with frontend and business teams.

**Impact:**

* Reduced system downtime by 30%, improved API responsiveness, and achieved scalable handling of 50k+ daily users.
* Strengthened team practices, introducing maintainable, testable codebases and standardizing development processes.
* Enhanced user satisfaction and operational efficiency by providing faster, more reliable services and real-time notifications.
